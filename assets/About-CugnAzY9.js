The challenges that come from problem solving and reaching that solution are fun and interesting to me.",open:!1},{question:"Where are you from?",answer:"I am originally from Monterrey, Nuevo Leon in Mexico. I spent most of my life moving from city to city in Mexico eventually moving to the United States and later becoming a U.S. citizen. In the United States I have mostly lived in the great state of Texas and most recently decided to settle down for a while here in Austin, TX. All in all, my expereince moving around all my life has taught me to value different cultures and embrace all sorts of people from varying backgrounds.",open:!1},{question:"What inspires your art?",answer:"I will have to say music would be the main inspiration. However, the stories that develop through them are more at the core of what drives my art.",open:!1},{question:"Where did you go to school?",answer:"I graduated from the Univerity of Texas at Austin with a B.A. in Psychology and a Minor in English. Through out my college career I focused mainly on the research aspect of psychology. I was mostly interested in the real world applications of psychology and how to adapt it to my professional and personal life. Lets go Longhorns! A couple of years after graduating I entered a certificate program for data analysis and visualization. It was a 6 month intensive program focused on developing and polishing technical programming skills in Excel, Python, Javascript, SQL Databases, Tableau, Big Data and Machine Learning.",open:!1},{question:"How did you get involved in school?",answer:"I began getting involved during the first half of my sophomore year by joining the Conceptual Knowledge Lab led by Dr. Reeves at The University of Texas at Austin. The lab focused on how language—particularly figurative language—affects cognition. By my final year in the internship, I was responsible for developing study materials in Python, which became central to the lab’s experiments. I also had the opportunity to represent the university by presenting our findings at two academic conferences.",open:!1},{question:"What are your interests?",answer:"I enjoy exploring new ideas across programming, psychology, and art. In programming, I'm particularly interested in database development and data visualization. In psychology, my focus is on industrial-organizational psychology—especially decision-making and improving workplace efficiency. I also have a passion for creating abstract art and learning how others perceive the world.",open:!1},{question:"Do you enjoy any sports?",answer:"Love a good game of soccer.

Over time, that same creative energy brought me into the world of software development, where I now build systems and tools that are both functional and expressive. </p><p data-v-74772466> Outside of work, I still enjoy painting, gaming, and exploring new technologies.
